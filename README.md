# Encoder-Decoder-module-for-Hamming-code-generation
– Created an encoder-decoder system to generate and process Hamming codes, converting 4-bit data into a 7-bit
Hamming code incorporating parity bits for error detection and correction.
– Implemented decoding functionality to identify and correct errors within the Hamming code.
